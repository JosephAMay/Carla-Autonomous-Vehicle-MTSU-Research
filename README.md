# Carla-Autonomous-Vehicle-MTSU-Research
Carla Autonomous Vehicle testing
We are using the CARLA Simulator to train and test different systems for an autonomous vehicle. 
We have a golf cart in real life, and all our setup in the simulator tries to mimic the golf cart as much as possible. 
Our chosen car is a microlino which is the closest car in CARLA we could find to a golf cart. The sensor suite of the 
simulated car and the golf cart are identical: 3 camearas one on the hood, and two other positioned like side mirrors, 
2 radars attached on the hood and bumper, and imu and a gps.

We are hoping to train a deep learning agent in the simulator and use it to power the golf cart as it drives around MTSU.
